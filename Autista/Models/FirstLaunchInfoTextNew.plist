		<string>Autistaâ„¢  is designed to help autistic children with speech difficulties develop manual motor and oral motor skills, building an ability to communicate by pointing or speaking.  Autista bootstraps new skills by beginning from activities at which autistic children excel and that they enjoy -- assembling puzzles, for instance -- and harnessing this motivation to approach new challenges.

Children begin by learning to point and to drag puzzle pieces in Point Mode.  In addition to developing these basic motor skills, they become accustomed to the idea that objects consist of sequences of parts.

With Type Mode, children progress from pointing at puzzle pieces in sequence to pointing at letters of the alphabet in sequence, making the jump from communicating in pictures to communicating in words.  Each letter pressed on the keyboard causes a puzzle piece to spring into place.

In Speak Mode, children practice pronouncing syllables in sequence. Each syllable pronounced causes a puzzle piece to spring into place.</string>

		<string>The more Autista is used, the more it learns and adapts to your child&apos;s specific needs. For example, the app can detect repetitive behavior and advance gameplay accordingly.

The app also logs all user interactions, allowing researchers or therapists to analyze these data to help provide a better learning experience for your child.</string>

		<key>text</key>
		<string>If you or your child (of whom you are the parent or legal guardian) are autistic and have trouble with communicative speech, you can help by enabling the app to send logs of your activities in the app and, if you are happy to do so, audio recordings during Speak Mode.  Activity logs would be sent anonymously, in a way that will not allow you or your child to be identified from them.  Voice recordings would not be linked to your or your child&apos;s name, although there is a small chance that a voice could be recognised by someone who knows it.  Activity logs and voice recordings would be used for scientific research to improve communication therapies, and may be reported in publications and in presentations at scientific meetings. Your decision as to whether to allow your activity log and/or voice recording to be used for this research is completely voluntary and will not affect your ability to use this app.  If you ever change your mind as to whether to send logs and/or voice recordings, just press the (i) symbol to return to this page and change these settings, or change them in the Speak Mode settings screen.
